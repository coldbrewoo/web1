    <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" title="Deep learning.net">Machine learning</a></strong> Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
    <p><br>Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term "Machine Learning" in 1959 while at IBM. Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data[4] – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions,through building a model from sample inputs.
